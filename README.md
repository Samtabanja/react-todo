This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Task
Build a simple Todo app using React. It is client-side only, so you should track all state inside of your app.

Feel free to use any styling that you would like. Complete as much of the functionality below as you can. If you have time, and feel motivated, feel free to add anything else that may demonstrate your knowledge/skills/creativity.
You can start your app using 'create-react-app'

Your app should include the following functionality
- Add a Todo item
- List Todo items
- Toggle Todo items as complete using a checkbox. Completed Todo items should be greyed out with a strikethrough line through them.
- A "Clear Complete" button removes all Todos that are marked as completed (button should be disabled if no Todos are done)

Bonus: Add a filter that will display All/Incomplete/Complete todos based on what option is selected.
